# *Soniquete* - A Digital Flamenco Magazine

### What is this project about?
This repository contains the code of a web page. This web is a Digital Magazine about Flamenco called *Soniquete*. There we can find articles, reviews and artists related to Flamenco. 

### How was this project created?
I have used `PHP`,`HTML`,`CSS` and `JavaScript` for the development of the project. In addition, I have used a local database for storing articles, artist reviews and comments that can be found in `soniquete.sql`. 
All the articles and artist reviews are AI generated because the main purpose of this project was showing
the knowledge and skills to develop a web page, not showing the ability to write or demonstrating creativity.

### Purpose of the project
My name is Mario Pantoja Castro. I'm a spanish student who is doing an Erasmus mobility for one year in Gdansk, Poland. This is a project for the course **Website Development Technologies**, from the *Politechnika University of Gdansk*. 

### Set up
In order to render the web page I have used the **Apache** server and **MySQL** for managing the database. 
Specifically, I have installed **XAMPP** distribution to use both, Apache and MySQL. I have always rendered the
page locally and I placed the hole project directory `soniquete` in `xampp/htdocs`. Other ways can be used to render this project. The only thing you must do is generating the database using the `soniquete.sql` file. For this, MySQL is recommended. I have obtained the `soniquete.sql` file automatically using the *phpMyAdmin* software
that XAMPP distribution provides. Notice that in the `inludes/config.php` file I have 
used the user `root` and that no `pass` is specified. This should be modified depending on each user.
For the rest, the web page should work properly using a HTTP Server like Apache.

### Final comments for the teacher
Dear Pawe≈Ç Syty, I tried to do my best with this project. I know there are lot of things that can be improved,
starting with the repository organization, but it's my first time developing a web page. 

I hope you enjoy it!
